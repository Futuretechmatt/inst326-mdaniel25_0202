Week 1

I asked ChatGPT how to sort data and help me better understand how to write new
programming languages I was learning. I also used AI to help me understand and refresh
my knowledge on certain python concepts such as varaibles, datatypes, and Arithmetic & Expressions.
Finally, I also used AI to help teach me and understand how to perform SQL coding as I
am a beginner.

Week 2

This week, I used ChatGPT to help me learn and relearn some of the programming basics of Python, 
such as utilizing different string methods, boolean expressions, and variable types. The AI tool 
provided me with various examples of the variable types and expressions in action, such as 
stripping white spaces, concatenating string names, using the find function to parse lines of code 
without a list, and implementing them properly. I also used it to help me troubleshoot some code I 
have been practicing with, both in Python and SQLite, to help me enhance my understanding of any 
logical or syntax errors I have made.


Week 3
This week, I used ChatGPT to help me relearn some of the programming basics of Python, such as 
conditionals, loops, lists, and the implementation of logical operators. The system gave me some 
examples and understanding of how each of these coding elements works separately and as a whole 
in the program, which guided me in enhancing my coding skills and in the programming exercises and 
assignments. I also used AI to give me a conceptual understanding of functions and modules.
