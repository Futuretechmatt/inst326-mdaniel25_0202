Week 1

I asked ChatGPT how to sort data and help me better understand how to write new
programming languages I was learning. I also used AI to help me understand and refresh
my knowledge on certain python concepts such as varaibles, datatypes, and Arithmetic & Expressions.
Finally, I also used AI to help teach me and understand how to perform SQL coding as I
am a beginner.
