Week 1

I asked ChatGPT how to sort data and help me better understand how to write new
programming languages I was learning. I also used AI to help me understand and refresh
my knowledge on certain python concepts such as varaibles, datatypes, and Arithmetic & Expressions.
Finally, I also used AI to help teach me and understand how to perform SQL coding as I
am a beginner.

Week 2

This week, I used ChatGPT to help me learn and relearn some of the programming basics of Python, 
such as utilizing different string methods, boolean expressions, and variable types. The AI tool 
provided me with various examples of the variable types and expressions in action, such as 
stripping white spaces, concatenating string names, using the find function to parse lines of code 
without a list, and implementing them properly. I also used it to help me troubleshoot some code I 
have been practicing with, both in Python and SQLite, to help me enhance my understanding of any 
logical or syntax errors I have made.


Week 3
This week, I used ChatGPT to help me relearn some of the programming basics of Python, such as 
conditionals, loops, lists, and the implementation of logical operators. The system gave me some 
examples and understanding of how each of these coding elements works separately and as a whole 
in the program, which guided me in enhancing my coding skills, and in the programming exercises, and 
assignments. I also used AI to give me a conceptual understanding of functions and modules. In 
In addition to the group project, I used AI to help organize my ideas on the features, scope, and 
must-have and nice-to-have features on our project, and translate them into the project requirements 
that we used to draft and structure our project charter.

Week 4
In this week's module, I used ChatGPT to help me solidify my understanding of last week's
topics of building, creating, and defining functions, and how to implement them with
variables and string basics. I am a little rusty with functions, so I used this AI tool to 
help me debug and structure my code properly to help guide me and enhance my understanding
of its functionality and purpose. Additionally, I used AI this week to help teach me some 
of the basics of classes and how the concept can be applied to real-life everyday objects
, and contain both attributes and methods. Visualizing it this way was a key step in 
deepening my understanding of this topic. Finally, another way I used AI this week
was to demonstrate examples and debug my SQL code on string and numeric 
functions. Throughout the week, I will use this tool to continue to help me plan and
structure parts of the group project in preparation for its next phase.
